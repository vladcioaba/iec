	All the programs we have looked at so far use input only from the keyboard, and output only to the screen. If we were
	restricted to use only the keyboard and screen as input and output devices, it would be difficult to handle large
	amounts of input data, and output data would always be lost as soon as we turned the computer off. To avoid these
	problems, we can store data in some secondary storage device, usually magnetic tapes or discs. Data can be created by
	one program, stored on these devices, and then accessed or modified by other programs when necessary. To achieve this,
	the data is packaged up on the storage devices as data structures called <span class="highlight">files</span>.

	The easiest way to think about a file is as a linear sequence of characters. In a simplifed picture (which ignores
	special characters for text formatting) these lecture notes might be stored in a file called "Lecture_4" as:
