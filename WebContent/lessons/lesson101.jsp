<div class="textblock">C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT&T Bell Laboratories in the early 1980's, and
	is based on the C language. The name is a pun - "++" is a syntactic construct used in C (to increment a variable), and
	C++ is intended as an incremental improvement of C. Most of C is a subset of C++, so that most C programs can be
	compiled (i.e. converted into a series of low-level instructions that the computer can execute directly) using a C++
	compiler.</div>

<div class="textblock">
	The best way to learn a programming language is to try writing programs and test them on a computer! To do this, we
	need several pieces of software:
	<ul>
		<li>An editor with which to write and modify the C++ program components or source code,</li>
		<li>A compiler with which to convert the source code into machine instructions which can be executed by the
			computer directly,</li>
		<li>A linking program with which to link the compiled program components with each other and with a selection of
			routines from existing libraries of computer code, in order to form the complete machine-executable object program,</li>
		<li>A debugger to help diagnose problems, either in compiling programs in the first place, or if the object
			program runs but gives unintended results.</li>
	</ul>
