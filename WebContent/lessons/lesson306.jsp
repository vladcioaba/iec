<div class="textblock">One of the main purposes of using functions is to aid in the top down design of programs.
	During the design stage, as a problem is subdivided into tasks (and then into sub-tasks, sub-sub-tasks, etc.), the
	problem solver (programmer) should have to consider only what a function is to do and not be concerned about the
	details of the function. The function name and comments at the beginning of the function should be sufficient to inform
	the user as to what the function does. (Indeed, during the early stages of program development, experienced programmers
	often use simple "dummy" functions or stubs, which simply return an arbitrary value of the correct type, to test out
	the control flow of the main or higher level program component.)</div>

<div class="textblock">Developing functions in this manner is referred to as functional or procedural abstraction.
	This process is aided by the use of value parameters and local variables declared within the body of a function.
	Functions written in this manner can be regarded as "black boxes". As users of the function, we neither know nor care
	why they work.</div>
