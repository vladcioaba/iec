	There are several editors available for UNIX-based systems. Two of the most popular editors are <span class="highlight">emacs</span>
	and <span class="highlight">vi</span>. For the compiler and linker, we will be using the GNU g++ compiler/linker, and
	for the debugger we will be using the GNU debugger gdb. For those that prefer an integrated development environment
	(IDE) that combines an editor, a compiler, a linking program and a debugger in a single programming environment (in a
	similar way to Microsoft Developer Studio under Windows NT), there are also IDEs available for UNIX (e.g. Eclipse,
	xcode, kdevelop etc.)

<div class="textblock">Here is brief look at C++ comments:</div>

<div class="code">
	// The C++ compiler ignores comments which start with double slashes like this, up to the end of the line. <br> <br>
	/* Comments can also be written starting with a slash followed by a star, and ending with a star followed by a slash.
	As you can see, comments written in this way can span more than one line. */ <br> <br> /* Programs should
	ALWAYS include plenty of comments! */ <br>

<div class="textblock">Next we'll look at a complete C++ program which prompts the user for the current year, the
	user's current age, and another year. It then calculates the age that the user was or will be in the second year
	entered.</div>
