	As we have seen, C++ programs can be written using many English words. It is useful to think of words found in a
	program as being one of three types:
	<ul>
		<li>Reserved Words. These are words such as if, int and else, which have a predefined meaning that cannot be
			changed. Here's a more complete list.</li>
		<li>Library Identifiers. These words are supplied default meanings by the programming environment, and should
			only have their meanings changed if the programmer has strong reasons for doing so. Examples are cin, cout and sqrt
			(square root).</li>
		<li>Programmer-supplied Identifiers. These words are "created" by the programmer, and are typically variable
			names, such as year_now and another_age.</li>
	</ul>
	An identifier cannot be any sequence of symbols. A valid identifier must start with a letter of the alphabet or an
	underscore ("_") and must consist only of letters, digits, and underscores.
