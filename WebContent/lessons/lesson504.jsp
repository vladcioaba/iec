	readable by the use of functional abstraction. By making the body of the loop into a function call, its design can be
	separated from the design of the rest of the program, and problems with scoping of variables and overloading of
	variable names can be avoided.</div>

<div class="textblock">In this lecture we have seen how a Boolean data type can be created using a named
	enumeration, and how functions can be written which return "True" or "False". We have seen how these functions can be
	used as conditions in branch and loop statements. We have discussed the relationship between "if", "while" and "do ...
	while" loops, and shown how nested "if" statements can in some cases be re-written as "switch" statements.</div>
